- Repository appears to be in early/experimental stage
- Future development will need to establish appropriate tooling based on the intended project type

## Next Steps

- Setting up appropriate package management (npm, pip, cargo, etc.) based on chosen language
- Establishing build and test scripts
- Creating proper project structure
- Adding a README.md to document the project's purpose
